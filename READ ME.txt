The folders/files in this directory are as follows:

benchmarks - Contains all Single Function SyGuS CLIA Benchmarks which serve as the formal specifications.

CBPSResults- Contains 10 csv files, each from a full run of the benchmarks using the CBPS algorithm. The csv files contain 
the benchmark, whether synthesis was successful, the time taken, the program returned and that program's length.
RBPSResults - Contains 10 csv files, each from a full run of the benchmarks using the CBPS algorithm. The csv files are in the same format
as noted above.

RBPSResults.csv - Takes the files in the RBPSResults folder and calculates median and max synthesis time of the runs.
CBPSResults.csv - Same concept as RBPSResults.csv.

JarsForReplicability - Contains jars that when executed will perform a 
single run of the benchmarks. Both jars write a results file as synthesis is achieved.
There are two jars, one for RBPS and one for CBPS. These can be executed with the following commands:
java -jar CBPSTestBed.jar
java -jar RBPSTestBed.jar

The jars are reliant on benchmarks and params i.e. they should be run in the folder structure
of this directory.

params - Establishes evolutionary parameters, class locations, etc. for the Genetic
Programming based classifier.
